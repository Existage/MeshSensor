# MeshSensor
This project contains all the files and schematics to create the ESP32-based mesh sensor network to measure an environment and to log the data to a .csv file. Currently the project only makes use of the CO2 and PM sensors but could be expanded as many of the additional GPIO pins are still availible for use.
