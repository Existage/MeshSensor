# MeshSensor
This project contains all the files and schematics to create the ESP32-based mesh sensor network to measure an environment and determine the quality of the air in the environment. Currently the project only makes use of the CO2 and PM sensors but could be expanded as many of the additional gpio pins are still availible for access.
